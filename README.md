# Video-inbetweening-using-direct-CVAE-CGAN
Using Deep Learning Techniques to generate moving videos from still images, by realistic interpolation of the initial and final image, considering the challenge of memory limitations due to huge pixel sizes of the images.  Our approach was based on the following two papers, mainly on [1]; [1] Haoye Cai, Chunyan Bai, Yu-Wing Tai, and Chi-Keung Tang. Deep video generation, prediction and completion of human action sequences. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) [2] Yunpeng Li, Dominik Roblek, and Marco Tagliasacchi.
